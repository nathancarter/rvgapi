# R VG API

The game [Vainglory](http://www.vainglorygame.com) has [an API](http://developer.vainglorygame.com/)
for getting statistics about matches that have transpired.

This project provides [R6 classes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html)
(for the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/)) for accessing the API.

The API is still in alpha, and changes a lot.  Like, a *lot*.  Thus this interface to it will also change a lot,
and may be out of date at any given moment.

To see an example of how it works, check out [the test file](testing-rvgapi.html).
